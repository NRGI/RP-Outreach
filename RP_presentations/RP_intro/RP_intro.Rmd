##Timeline
> - **Before 2013**: Citizens had limited information on revenues from extractive sector projects in their country. This made it difficult for them to hold governments and companies accountable.
> - **2013 to Present**: Mandatory disclosure laws passed in the [EU](http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/PWYP-fact-sheet-on-EU-Accounting-and-Transparency-Directives.pdf), [Canada](http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Factsheet_for_Canadian_mandatory_reporting_legislation.pdf), UK and Norway require extractive sector companies to disclose payments to government on a project by project basis.
> - **This data are however, difficult to use**: Payment data are predominantly available as tables in PDF reports that are scattered across different websites without a standard structure or reporting format. They also use inconsistent standards for different terms, for instance, the same government agency might be called several different names in different reports. As a result, simple things like finding the total payments received by a country were extremely difficult to accomplish.
> - **2017 to present**: NRGI sets up a semi-automated data pipeline that scrapes, cleans and standardize payment data from reports that are in a wide variety of formats scattered across different portals and websites.
