## ResourceProjects.org

_Data on payments to governments from extractive sector companies on a project by project basis_<!-- .element: class="testRed"-->

* **The data**: 371.3 billion USD in payments from 709 reports by 584 companies disclosed in 17 reporting jurisdictions over 4 years (2014 to 2017)

  * Most of this data are from tables in pdfs that are not machine readeable<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * These reports are scattered across different websites and repositories<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * All 17 reporting jurisdictions have differing (or no) standards for how these payment tables should be structured<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * The reported data often is messy and uses non-standard names for projects and government agencies<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* ResourceProjects cleans and standaridizes data from all these reports and provides them on an easy to use data portal.
