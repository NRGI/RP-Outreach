##The good

- Moved from manual scraping and cleaning to a semi-automated system
    - Absolutely critical. ResourceProjects would have been impossible to sustaine over the long-term without this.
    - Improved data quality. Better error tracing, and reproducibility.
- User friendly, data rich website
    - Moved from a data and UI poor website to a more user friendly data rich website
- Potential for several data product spin-offs
    - Cleaning files allow us to link different data sources together
    - Secondary data on different variables like projects, govt. agencies and companies enrich analytical possibilities
- Potential for ramping up data use

##The not so good

- Data Use
    - Almost non-existent at this point. We need to spend time generating some early use cases for the data.
- Poor internal mainstreaming
    - We have barely done anything to mainstream ResourceProjects within NRGI
- Poor external marketing
    - We haven't done a single analytical piece or blog that uses ResourceProjects data
- Website has scope for improvement
    - The website is still low on use
    - Performance in terms of speed, design and content can be improved

##Building on the good

- **Data-Pipeline**: 
    - Complete the few missing pieces in the data pipeline
    - [Package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) all the R code
- **Website**: 
    - Get an external vendor to provide UI and content improvements to make the website more user friendly
    - A company page
    - A source page that allows users to manage reports better
- **Product spin-offs**: 
    - Setup the data workflow such that anyone can use our cleaning files

##Fixing the not so good

- **Data Use**: 
    - Create a laundry list of [data use ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Irfuz_kfmcU4RGjGKWxuFDIeY2_Ud6wuuk9Qiuwj9fY/edit?usp=sharing) and prioritize them. Start executing ideas from the top.
    - Identify a list of potential collaborators.
- **Internal mainstreaming**: 
    - A webinar on ResourceProjects will also help. 
    - What type of data use ideas can help us increase internal visibility?
- **External marketing:**: 
    - Start a social media campaign to plug the website. 
    - What type of data use ideas can help us increase external marketing?


##Challenges

- Inadequate staff resources
- Funding
- Lack of inherent data value
