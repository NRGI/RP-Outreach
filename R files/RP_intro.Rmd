## Summary
This R notebook generates all the files and analysis used for the Introduction to RP presentation.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse);

allSources <- read_csv("../../resource-project-data/Data Cleaning/Payment Data Pipeline/data/Current website data/allSource.csv")
allProjects <- read_csv("../../resource-project-data/Data Cleaning/Payment Data Pipeline/data/Current website data/allProject.csv")
allEntities <- read_csv("../../resource-project-data/Data Cleaning/Payment Data Pipeline/data/Current website data/allEntity.csv")
```

First lets gather some basic summary information.

Number of reporting jurisdictions
```{r}
print(paste("The total payment reported is ", round(sum(allProjects$projectPayment, na.rm = T)/1e9, 1), "billion USD"))
print(paste("The number of reporting reports are ", n_distinct(allSources$sourceID)))
print(paste("The number of reporting jurisdictions are ", n_distinct(allSources$reportingCountry)))
print(paste("The number of reporting companies are ", n_distinct(allSources$reportingCompany)))
print(paste("For the years", min(allSources$reportYear), "to", max(allSources$reportYear)))

```
Number of reporting companies.
```{r}
n_distinct()
```
